Finishing sentences is time consuming and boring. This project implements an autocomplete query system that predicts the next word in a sentence.

## Features
* **Efficient Query Matching:** Implements a fast autocomplete functionality by searching for terms that match a given query prefix. Matches are case-sensitive and only compare prefixes.
* **Lexicographic Sorting:** Reads a file of terms and sorts them in ascending lexicographic order for efficient searching and retrieval.
* **Binary Search Optimization:** Uses binary search to locate the first and last occurrence of a matching query term in O(log(n)) time, ensuring quick lookups.
* **Weighted Sorting of Results:** Extracts the terms that match the query and sorts them by weight in non-increasing order to prioritize more relevant terms.

## Tech Stack
* **C:** Used for implementing the autocomplete query system.
