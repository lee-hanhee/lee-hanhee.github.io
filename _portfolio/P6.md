The adaptive daylight harvesting system is designed to optimize energy usage in urban residential buildings in Lagos, Nigeria by dynamically adjusting lighting based on environmental conditions and user preferences. The system integrates an intelligent control mechanism that switches between solar and grid power, ensuring efficient energy consumption while maintaining a comfortable lighting environment.

## Features
- **Automated Lighting Adjustment:** Uses photoresistors to detect ambient light levels and adjust brightness accordingly.
- **Manual Override:** Users can control lighting intensity manually using a potentiometer.
- **Energy Source Switching:** The system automatically toggles between solar and grid power for optimal energy efficiency.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A labeled control panel enables seamless interaction with system functionalities.

## Subsystem Features

### **Structural Subsystem**
- **Control Panel:** Houses user interface components including an on/off switch, an automatic/manual mode selector, and a brightness adjuster.
- **Battery Box:** Securely encloses the power system and allows for quick battery replacements.

### **LED Subsystem**
- **Lighting Automation:** LEDs adjust brightness based on real-time photoresistor readings to optimize energy use.
- **LED Indicator System:** Displays system status, including power source and lighting mode.

### **Battery Subsystem**
- **Relay-based Power Switching:** Automatically switches between grid and solar power depending on available energy sources.
- **Capacitor Integration:** Ensures stable power delivery by bridging relay switching delays.

### **Lighting Subsystem**
- **Photoresistor-based Adaptive Control:** Monitors light levels to maintain an optimal room brightness.
- **Mode Selection Mechanism:** Allows switching between automatic and manual control for user flexibility.

## Tech Stack
* **Python:** Used to program the microcontroller and develop the control system.
* **CAD Software:** Utilized for designing the control panel and battery box.
