Simulating a fuel cell stack to find the optimal operating conditions and design parameters is computationally expensive. This project uses a MLP to train a surrogate model to predict the performance of a fuel cell stack. A genetic optimization algorithm was used to optimize the model to find the optimal operating conditions and design parameters.

Specifically, two neural networks were developed to predict the pressure drop and stack temperature of the fuel cell stack. These models were then used as the objective functions for the genetic optimization algorithm to find the best conditions and dimensions of the fuel cell stack for a low pressure drop, and a stack temperature within the range of 50-70 degrees Celsius. In order to verify the optimal conditions and dimensions, these exact parameters were simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics to compare the results with the predictions of the neural networks, reaching a 2% error rate.

## Features
* **[Literature Review](/files/P2/Literature_Review.pdf):** Developed a comprehensive understanding of the intersection between fuel cell technology and how machine learning can be used to optimize fuel cell performance metrics. 
* **Evaluation:** Used RMSE as the main evaluation metric to compare the pressure drop and stack temperature predictions between the final model and the baseline models, reaching an RMSE of 11 (Pa) and 1 (degC) respectively.
* **Multiphysics Simulations:** Used COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate the fuel cell stack and generate the dataset for training the neural networks.
* **Genetic Optimization:** Developed a genetic optimization to find the optimal operating conditions and design parameters of the fuel cell stack.
* **[GUI](https://pemfc-prediction.onrender.com):** Developed a UI to allow users to use the final model to predict performances of certain fuel cell stack designs w.r.t. pressure drop and stack temperature, and visualize the data. 

## Tech Stack
* **PyTorch:** Used for developing MLP models. 
* **Distributed Evolutionary Algorithm (DEAP):** Genetic optimization algorithm.
* **MATLAB:** Used for data preprocessing, visualizations, and regression learner & neural net fitting applications for simple model training as baseline. 
* **COMSOL Multiphysics:** Used for multiphysics simulations.
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Develop frontend for the GUI.
* **Flask:** Used to integrate the MLP models and the data visualizations into the frontend.
