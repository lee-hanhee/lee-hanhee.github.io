Seam carving is a content-aware image resizing technique that resizes an image by removing the least important pixels. This project implements the seam carving algorithm to resize images.

## Features
* **Content-Aware Image Resizing:** Implements the seam carving technique to resize images by intelligently removing pixels while preserving important visual features.
* **Dual-Gradient Energy Function Calculation:** Computes the energy of each pixel based on color gradients to determine its importance in the image.
* **Dynamic Seam Identification:** Uses dynamic programming to find the optimal vertical seam with the lowest cumulative energy, ensuring minimal visual distortion.
* **Seam Removal Algorithm:** Removes the identified seam from the image, progressively reducing its width while maintaining structural integrity.
* **Iterative Seam Removal:** Supports repeated seam removals to progressively resize images, adapting to different aspect ratios.

## Tech Stack
* **C:** Used for implementing the seam carving algorithm.
