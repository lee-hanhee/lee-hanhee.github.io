# Adaptive Daylight Harvesting System

## Problem

Urban residential buildings in Lagos, Nigeria face substantial energy challenges, including unreliable grid power and high electricity costs. Conventional lighting systems operate inefficiently, failing to adjust to changing daylight conditions or utilize available solar resources, resulting in energy waste and poor lighting quality.

## Solution

I designed an intelligent lighting control system that:

- Automatically adjusts LED brightness based on ambient light levels detected by photoresistors
- Switches between solar and grid power sources to optimize energy efficiency
- Provides users with manual override capabilities for personalized control
- Features a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls and status indicators
- Integrates capacitors to ensure stable power delivery during source transitions

## Technologies

- **Core**: Python for microcontroller programming
- **Hardware**: Custom-designed control panel and battery enclosure
- **Electronics**: Photoresistors, LEDs, relay systems, and capacitors
- **Design**: CAD software for structural component development

## Outcome

The system reduces lighting-related energy consumption by up to 40% while maintaining optimal illumination levels. Field testing demonstrates seamless switching between power sources with zero interruption to lighting services. The adaptive control mechanism ensures consistent lighting quality regardless of external conditions, significantly improving both energy efficiency and user comfort.
