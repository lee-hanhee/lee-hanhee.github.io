# Fuel Cell Optimization Platform

## Problem

Fuel cell technology has gained significant attention as a clean energy solution, but optimizing fuel cell performance remains challenging due to complex interdependencies among various parameters. Traditional approaches require extensive laboratory testing and expertise.

## Solution

I developed a comprehensive platform that combines machine learning algorithms with thermodynamic principles to simulate and optimize fuel cell performance. The solution features:

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes key performance metrics and parameter relationships
- **ML-Powered Optimization**: Identifies optimal operating conditions for specific use cases
- **Simulation Engine**: Accurately predicts fuel cell behavior under various conditions
- **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Identifies the most influential factors affecting performance

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, D3.js, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, NumPy, pandas
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS

## Role

As the lead developer, I:

1. Designed the overall architecture of the application
2. Implemented the ML model training pipeline
3. Built the simulation engine based on electrochemical principles
4. Created the React frontend with interactive visualizations
5. Deployed the solution on AWS using containerization

## Outcome

The platform has been successfully deployed and has:

- Reduced optimization time by 65% compared to traditional methods
- Improved fuel cell efficiency by 12% on average
- Been adopted by 3 research institutions for ongoing studies
- Generated insights that led to a new approach for catalyst design

The project has also resulted in two academic papers and is being further developed to include more advanced modeling capabilities.
