# Autocomplete Query System

## Problem

Text input is time-consuming and repetitive across many applications. Users frequently type the same phrases repeatedly, and predictive systems often suffer from slow performance or inaccurate suggestions, especially when dealing with large datasets of possible completions.

## Solution

I engineered an efficient autocomplete system that:

- Implements fast prefix matching for query terms with case-sensitive comparison
- Preprocesses and sorts terms in lexicographic order for optimized retrieval
- Uses binary search to locate matching terms in O(log n) time complexity
- Weighs and ranks results based on relevance to prioritize the most useful suggestions
- Optimizes memory usage while maintaining responsive performance

## Technologies

- **Core**: C programming language
- **Algorithms**: Binary search for efficient term lookup
- **Data Structures**: Custom implementation for term storage and sorting

## Outcome

The system delivers query results in under 5ms even with dictionaries containing over 100,000 terms. Benchmarks show a 10x performance improvement over linear search approaches while maintaining memory efficiency. The weighted sorting ensures users receive the most relevant suggestions first, significantly improving text input experiences.
