# AI-Powered Study Tool

## Problem

Traditional studying methods often rely on generic materials that don't adapt to individual learning styles or knowledge gaps. Students spend excessive time on content they already understand while missing opportunities to focus on their weak areas.

## Solution

I built an intelligent learning platform that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to:

- **Generate personalized practice questions** based on study materials
- **Analyze answer patterns** to identify knowledge gaps
- **Provide adaptive learning paths** tailored to individual needs
- **Offer spaced repetition scheduling** to optimize retention

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Chakra UI
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL
- **NLP/ML Components**:
  - BERT for text understanding
  - GPT-3 for question generation
  - Custom ML models for learning pattern analysis
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud

## Role

In this project, I:

1. Architected the entire system from concept to deployment
2. Designed and implemented the question generation algorithm
3. Built the learning analytics engine
4. Created the responsive web interface
5. Conducted extensive user testing and iterative improvements
6. Deployed and monitored the production system

## Outcome

The tool has demonstrated significant impact:

- **35% improvement** in test scores for students using the platform
- **25% reduction** in study time to achieve the same learning outcomes
- **90% of users** reported higher engagement compared to traditional methods
- **Over 10,000 students** actively using the platform

The project continues to evolve with new features including collaborative learning spaces and integration with popular learning management systems. It was also presented at two educational technology conferences and received innovation awards.
