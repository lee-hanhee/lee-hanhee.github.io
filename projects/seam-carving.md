# Seam Carving: Content-Aware Image Resizing

## Problem

Traditional image resizing techniques uniformly scale images, often distorting important visual elements. When resizing photographs or graphics with prominent features, standard methods frequently produce unnatural distortions or cut off critical parts of the image.

## Solution

I implemented a content-aware image resizing algorithm that:

- Calculates a dual-gradient energy function to identify the importance of each pixel
- Uses dynamic programming to find optimal seams with the lowest cumulative energy
- Intelligently removes these seams to reduce image width while preserving important content
- Supports iterative seam removal for progressive resizing
- Maintains structural integrity and visual coherence during the resizing process

## Technologies

- **Core**: C programming language
- **Image Processing**: Custom implementation of gradient functions and energy calculations
- **Algorithms**: Dynamic programming for optimal seam identification

## Outcome

The algorithm successfully resizes images while preserving their key visual elements, achieving significantly better results than traditional scaling techniques. Tests across various image types show that the implementation delivers natural-looking resized images with minimal computational overhead, maintaining important image features even with substantial size reductions.
